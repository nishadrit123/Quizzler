# Quizzler
This flutter app asks you a few true or false questions and grades based on the correct answers.
The questions are stored in a dart List in bank.dart file 
As the quiz proceeds, the bottom part of screen lights up showing a right(for correct answer) and wrong(for incorrect answer) symbol.
